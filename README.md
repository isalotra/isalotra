## üìö Theoretical Foundations

### Algorithmics & Data Structures
Understanding algorithms and data structures is fundamental in creating efficient data pipelines and optimized solutions.

- **Sorting and Searching**: Mastery of basic algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Binary Search.
- **Data Structures**: Familiar with arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and trees.
- **Big O Notation**: Strong understanding of time and space complexity to ensure scalable solutions.

### Software Design Principles
Applying design principles to create modular, maintainable, and reusable code.

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Striving for simplicity in code and design, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Ensuring that code is modular and reusable, reducing redundancy.
- **SOLID Principles**

### Design Patterns
Leveraging design patterns to solve recurring problems in a standard way, improving code readability and flexibility.

- **Singleton**: Ensuring a class has only one instance, often used in data access objects.
- **Factory**: Creating objects without specifying the exact class, commonly used in data pipeline processing.
- **Observer**: Allowing objects to observe changes in other objects, useful in event-driven architectures.
- **Decorator**: Adding new functionality to an object dynamically, helpful in extending data processing capabilities.
- **Adapter**: Making incompatible interfaces compatible, useful for integrating multiple data sources.

### Data Engineering Principles
Best practices for building scalable, reliable, and efficient data pipelines.

- **Data Modeling**: Structuring data to ensure efficient querying and storage.
- **ETL/ELT Processes**: Understanding Extract, Transform, Load methodologies and when to use each.
- **Batch vs. Stream Processing**: Choosing the appropriate method based on data latency requirements.
- **Data Quality Management**: Implementing practices to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and completeness.
- **Orchestration and Scheduling**: Leveraging tools like Apache Airflow to manage and automate complex workflows.
